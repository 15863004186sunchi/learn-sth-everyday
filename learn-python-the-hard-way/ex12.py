# In Terminal where you normally run python to run your scripts, type pydoc raw_input. Read what it says. If you're on Windows try python -m pydoc raw_input instead. Get the prompt of the command
# Get out of pydoc by typing q to quit. Python's document
# Look online for what the pydoc command does.
# Use pydoc to also read about open, file, os, and sys. It's alright(没问题的) if you do not understand those; just read through and take notes about interesting things.

#python -m pydoc -p port
#python -m pydoc open/file/os/sys
