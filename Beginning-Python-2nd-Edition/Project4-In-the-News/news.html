<h2><a name="2">Leo 5.4-b1 released</a></h2>
<pre>Leo <http://leoeditor.com/> 5.4-b1 is now available on SourceForge
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/>. Leo is an IDE, a PIM and
and an outliner.

*The highlights of Leo 5.4*

   - Added clone-find commands, a new way to use Leo.
   - The clone-find and tag-all-children commands unify clones and tags.
   - The new pyflakes and flake8 make it possible to check files from
   within Leo.
   - Added importers for freemind, mindjet, json and coffeescript files.
   - Rewrote the javascript importer. It can optionally generate section
   references.
   - Imported files can optionally contain section references.
   - The viewrendered plugin supports @pyplot nodes.
   - Improved the mod_http plugin.
   - @chapter trees need no longer be children of @chapters nodes.
   - All known bugs have been fixed.

*Leo is*:

   - A fully-featured IDE, with Emacs-like commands.
   - An outliner. Everything in Leo is an outline.
   - A Personal Information Manager.
   - A browser with a memory.
   - A powerful scripting environment.
   - A tool for studying other people's code.
   - Extensible via a simple plugin architecture.
   - A tool that plays well with IPython, vim and xemacs.
   - Written in 100% pure Python
   - Compatible with Python 2.6 and above or Python 3.0 and above.
   - A tool with an inspiring and active community.

*Leo's unique features*:

   - Always-present, persistent, outline structure.
   - Leo's underlying data is a Directed Acyclic Graph.
   - Clones create multiple views of an outline.
   - A simple, powerful, outline-oriented Python API.
   - Scripts and programs can be composed from outlines.
   - Importers convert flat text into outlines.
   - Scripts have full access to all of Leo's sources.
   - Commands that act on outline structure.
   Example: the rst3 command converts outlines to reStructuredText.
   - @test and @suite scripts create unit tests automatically.
   - @button scripts apply scripts to outline data.
   - Outline-oriented directives.

Simulating these features in vim, Emacs or Eclipse is possible,
just as it is possible to simulate Python in assembly language...
